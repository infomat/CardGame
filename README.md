# INFO8180 Assignment2 Card Game

## Requirement
In Lab, we built a simple javascript system to switch the image shown by clicking on a thumbnail (See Lab4 on my github if you missed it!). Use this concept to build the game of Concentration, where cards are randomly laid out face down, and two cards are flipped over at each turn. The object of the game is to find all the matching cards (leave them flipped over once found to be a match!).
The cards can be any image you choose, and the design is completely up to you! (2 rows of 5 cards is sufficient for this exercise!)
You may use Bootstrap for styles, but not Javascript.
You may use jQuery for javascript.
The user experience should be consistent, no matter the screen size!

```bash
- Build Game of Concentration
- There are 2 rows of 5 cards and randomly alid out facec down
- All Cards are face down
- Two Cards are flipped over at each turn
- If two cards which are flipped over are macthed, then leave them flipped over
- Use Bootstrap & JQuery
```

## Configuration
Not required.
Enjoy the game!!!
